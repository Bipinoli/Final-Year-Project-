## Message to Aayush

The dataset I used can be found in ` data/full_shifted_dataset/original ` <br>
`full_shifted_dataset` is the processed dataset you can use directly <br><br>

Names of the folders shouldn't be changed as the same name is used across all the processed directory and api server. <br><br>


## General Message
Following directory were exempted from adding <br>
```
models/
logs/
```
**models** <br>
` It stores all the trained model ` <br><br>

**logs** <br>
```
It stores the logs of all the training and embedding related 
activities for the visualization with tensorboard.
```
> models/ and logs/ took a long time during git add so i added them in .gitignore
